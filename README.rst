Note:
-----

- ProDuSe makes use of `ClipOverlap <https://github.com/innovate-invent/clip>`_ in its pipeline with arguments -abt8.
- bwa mem is the aligner used.

Collapse
--------

Collapse reduces records with the same reference start position, forward/reverse flag and barcode within a specified Hamming distance to a single concensus family record. A consensus family record is essentially a pileup of the family member records and the most common operation/base at each position is retained.
The families are first collapsed if the barcodes are identical into "proto-families". These proto-families barcodes are then compared to each other producing a graph with node weights of the proto-family size and edge weights of their Hamming distances. The graph is reduced to a minimum spanning forest where any edges above threshold are removed. Each tree in the forest is further reduced to a diameter twice the threshold while maximising each subtrees node weight. 
A concensus of each tree is then finalised.

Each family record is output with two additional tags:

- fQ: Integer array containing Phred score of wrong base chosen during collapse
- fC: Integer array containing pairs (simmilar to a CIGAR) of count and depth representing, from the start of the alignment, the depth of the family at a position
